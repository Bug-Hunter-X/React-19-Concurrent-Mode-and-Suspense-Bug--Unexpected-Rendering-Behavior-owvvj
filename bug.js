This bug occurs when using the new React 19 features, specifically the use of concurrent mode and Suspense.  The issue manifests as unexpected rendering behavior or performance problems, often related to the timing of state updates and asynchronous operations.  The exact symptoms can vary greatly but may involve components not updating correctly, stale props, or unexpected behavior from Suspense boundaries.
